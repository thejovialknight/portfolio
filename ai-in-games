<h2>regarding the peculiarity of machine learning in game systems</h2>
<p>The idea of applying machine learning technology to game systems is intriguing, but carries with it a coincident sense of peculiarity. When I think about it, at least, the impression these sorts of projects impart is that of a toy or Warhol-esque experimentation. Though the possible applications unimaginably immense, it feels as if it may prove difficult to wrangle the technology in a way that feels <em>right</em> in some abstract sense.</p>

<h3>Audiovisual supplements</h3>
<p>The production of most games requires a massive amount of both visual and auditory work, which has increasingly been a bottleneck on game content generation. Perhaps the most innocuous usage of AI in games is to fill out that content <em>which does not in any way alter or interact with the formal structure of the game system itself.</em></p>
<h3>Content generation</h3>
<p>When designers start dabbling in using AI technology for procedural generation of content which contains <em>meaning to the story</em>, things start getting a little hairy.</p>
<h3>As a core mechanic</h3>
<p>There's not necessarily a hard definition distinguishing this category from the previous, but of course, a quantitative factor can become qualitative if the range is wide enough.</p>
