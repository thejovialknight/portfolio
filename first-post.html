<h1>The point of life</h1>
<h2>regarding game design as art and craft</h2>  
<p>I was browsing through <a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a> today (as befits those of only the highest class and distinction) and discovered a fun and archaic looking game called <a href="https://bitglint.itch.io/melkhiors-mansion">Melkhior's Mansion</a>.</p>
<p>The product itself appears to be a pitch perfect homage to a legacy genre of game I only wish I were the type of person to remember fondly. It has a surreal, brightly contrasting 15 color pallete which fits right in with its isometric arenas full of chests, keys, doors, and monsters. Due my ignorance of the form, I shall defer to the user <a href="https://itch.io/profile/monkeybot">monkeybot</a>, who comments:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>"That's great,Took me strainght back to 1984!!  Most excellent!"</p> 
</blockquote>
<p>And that's pretty much all there is to say.</p>
<p>I noticed a thread near the top between commenter <a href="https://itch.io/profile/shino1">Deerstalker Games</a> and the developer, <a href="https://itch.io/profile/shino1">BitGlint Games</a>, who's arguments (if you like) about the design of the game got me thinking about the massive diversity in possible ways of thinking about the design, art, and craft of games in general. It seems this a matrix too often unnoticed, but I think I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>The thread begins with a negative review of the game by Deerstalker.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Am I missing something? It seemed to me as if enemy movements were completely random, which in a game with one-hit kills and limited lives is kinda insane. Isn't entire point of any platformer, isometric or not, is ability to predict timing of your enemies and obstacles so you can plan your movement? I haven't much experience with isometric platformers, but both Batman and Head Over Heels remakes had predictable and easily read enemy patterns - it was clear how to avoid them, the difficulty was in the execution (also in traps and puzzles).</p>
    <p>The aesthetics are amazing and so is the idea, but I genuinelly cannot grasp enemy patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A seemingly reasonable complaint. The developer, BitGlint, responds with some explanation.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Thanks for the feedback. It's based on Atic Atac on the ZX Spectrum, which had random movement patterns. Quite a lot of games back then had random movement, especially the Ultimate games. This is a run around exploration game, whereas Batman and HoH are puzzle solving games, so it's important for enemy positions to be predictable. In games like Atic Atac, it isn't, in my humble opinion. Hope it hasn't spoilt it too much for you, but if it's not your thing, that's cool, thanks for trying it out. ;o)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An equally reasonable appeal to tradition, as well as vague allusions to genre differences between the mentioned games, ending with a friendly agree-to-disagree sentiment. Back to Deerstalker.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Everything inside of me as a designer yells that that's a terrible idea but I'm trying to be openminded. How do you prevent player from getting stuck in an unwinnable situation if patterns are random? It's a game with one hit kills and limited lives, and it might just downright not be your fault if you die and lose all your progress because all enemies randomly decided to surround you.</p>
    <p>It's not what I'd personally call good game design but if your primary goal isn't to make a game that appeals to a modern audience with 'fun' but to simply make a clear homage to these games of old without concern of modern concepts of 'fairness' (which to be fair is a bit nebulous) then sure, more power to you.</p>
    <p>I guess there's other revivals of classic isometric platform-adventures I can try, like Abbey of Crime, Naya's Quest, King Boo or Lumo.</p>
    <p>It's probably not for me, but a lot of people in this comment section seem to love it, so good on you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds impressive! Finally, back to BitGlint.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Thanks for the feedback. If you want to discuss it further then please feel free to contact me directly. I'm not one for public debate, it never ends well. :o</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That marks an end to the festivities, leaving us to imagine the rest.</p>

<p>Note that the following is only my feverish imaginings of what these two people stand for, and I haven't played the game being discussed. I'm going to utilize them as characters in my realm of analysis, but this thread was nothing more than a prompt to espouse my thoughts on game design. It might be interesting to go back and play the game and make a part 2 review piece, but that context doesn't seem to me particularly relevant to what I have to say here.</p>
<p>Let's try to break down what Deerstalker is arguing for here. They start off with a criticism that the game's enemy movements seem to be entirely randomized, and that what makes this sort of game fun is being able to plan out your moves in context of your knowledge of enemy behavior. The player's lack of ability to predict enemy movements prevents them from having a meaningful engagement with the game's systems.</p>
<p>They contrast this with counter examples of games which allow for this engagement, pointing out that the difficulty there comes from skill of execution, rather than from unpredictability. The designer's response states basically, "this is by design," and Deerstalker sums up their second main point.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>How do you prevent player from getting stuck in an unwinnable situation if patterns are random? It's a game with one hit kills and limited lives, and it might just downright not be your fault if you die and lose all your progress because all enemies randomly decided to surround you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without being able to predict enemy movement, the game loses its sense of fairness. The player can easily lose all their progress based on a random, unwinnable situation.</p>
<p>Let's compare this with the intent of the designer. Just like with Deerstalker's comments we can glean two main insights from BitGlint's response.</p>
<p>BitGlint first make their appeal to the legacy of the genre they are emulating, stating that "a lot of games back then had random movement." This is a good enough justification in of itself, but doesn't directly answer to Deerstalker's criticism. > horseshit tbh > It's only the next bit that has any suggestion of BitGlint's thoughts as a designer, despite the bit in question being quite vague.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>This is a run around exploration game, whereas Batman and HoH are puzzle solving games, so it's important for enemy positions to be predictable. In games like Atic Atac, it isn't, in my humble opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The distinction interpreted by BitGlint here is between a puzzle solving game which requires predictability in order to analyze and execute your plans, and what they call a "run around exploration game" which does not. The idea is that the goals for player engagement between the two genres are distinct. The puzzle solving genre uses planning and execution as its primary mode of play, and Melkhior's Castle uses exploration.</p>
<p>Deerstalker's second reply accurately identifies the problem of fairness in this design. However, in my opinion they fail to realize the ways in which this "flaw" actually plays to the strengths of the design's intended goal, which is to engage the player in a different way.</p>
<p>This seems to be a case of different implicit assumptions about the ideals of designing games.</p>
<p>There exists a hypothetical world in which there are core tenets of game design. Break these tenets and you sacrifice the game's level of "fun," or whatever other metrics one comes up with to judge the quality of a design. While one may not agree that these tenets exist, I think those internalized by Deerstalker are indicative of a failure within mainstream game design culture at large.</p>
<p>Chief among these distinctions is that video games, in order to be "fun", must be fair. To put it perhaps more generally, games must continally and sytematically curate the player experience so that (ideally) every experience they have in the game lives up to the maximum potential of the design. The player should be given decisions or challenges appropriate to their skill level, and those decisions or challenges are designed to be as interesting or engaging as possible.</p>
<p>Never should a challenge the player is meant to complete be impossible. That's just common sense!</p>
<p>This ideal of fairness specifically seems to be an area of focus with today's designers. It's hard to get through a design conversation about From Software's Dark Souls without mentioning that it's extreme difficulty nevertheless "feels fair." This almost seems to be the most universally understood legacy of From's Software, a sense that your inability to meet the game's challenge is always ultimately your fault, rather than the game's.</p>
<p>The appeal of many games is rooted in the human desire to control their environment. This can often lead to games that are nothing more than empty exercises in rote organization and, at best, optimization. These games which try for little more than exploiting this control element of our reward pathways are video game's heroin. They achieve nothing more than diminishing returns of empty satisfaction.</p>
<p>This is not to say games should not choose organization and optimization as the core element of their design. Sim City is arguably a more sophisticated version of this paradigm than a game like Skyrim, which is in turn more sophisticated an approach than Cookie Clicker. The relative merit of different paradigms is a function of the finer details of their approach. One of the core tenets I see in good game design is that a game's success is often determined by how interesting it's central lessons are. In other words, games are defined largely by what they teach you, and your enjoyment of them is largely determined by how engaged you are with what that is.</p>
<p>Dark Souls is so successful because of its singular focus on adherence to this tenet. Where Skyrim eventually devolves into the infamous "laundry list" of indistinguishable fetch quests whilst trying to somehow convince the player that this sort of gameplay has inherent value, Dark Souls is intended to exercise your ability to learn the ins and outs of both the geography of the environment and the skills of its combat system. Both fairness and meticulous curation of content is central to the player's process of improving this ability.</p>
<p>It may be self evident to you why fairness is important to the goal of player engagement in learning a game system. A players ability to learn the system is in some sense proportional to what extent it's possible to learn the underlying rules of that system, and the concept of fairness in games is in some sense equivalent to how consistent and ultimately readable those rules are. If I learn a particular enemy's attack pattern and then build up the mechanical skill to exploit it, I would be very discouraged if suddenly that pattern changed for seemingly no reason, and would never have been able to learn it in the first place if those patterns had always been random and unreadable.</p>
<p>Content curation is a related yet independent axis of design from fairness, and both of these are ultimately dependent on a feeling of direct communication between the designer and player.</p>
<p>When a puzzle game presents you with a novel idea and allows you to explore it within a set of chosen constraints, that's a direct form of communication from the designer to the player. The designer can further communicate their idea by modifying or complicating previously learned mechanics, peeling away the onion layers until the full scope of the game's ideas are revealed. This engagement is ultimately based on trust on the part of the player that whatever is being communicated by the game is intentional. When a player gets the sense that the communication they are receiving is unintentional, it can cause them to lose faith in the designer and perhaps also in the game's level of fairness. A designer can try to ensure this doesn't happen by curating every moment of gameplay to be as intentionally meaningful as possible. All of these things apply just as much to Dark Souls as they do to Portal.</p>
<p>Is it possible to build a sense of communication and trust with the player without careful content curation and without even a sense of fairness? I can think of no better example than what I consider to be one of the greatest games of all time: Spider Solitaire.</p>
<p>What is spider solitaire? Yhet</p>
<p>Is Spider Solitaire a curated experience? Not in its purest form, no. A randomly distributed deal of the cards isn't even guaranteed to be winnable at all. Even if playing on a computer with difficulty settings, the massive tree of choices still tends to effectively nullify the player's confidence in being able to win any given round.</p>
<p>Can Spider Solitaire be considered fair, then? It doesn't seem like it. The game's setup is entirely random, and more importantly, your success is quite often more a function of the card distribution than of the player's skill.</p>
<p>And yet, all it takes is a reframing of the question to turn those answers from no to yes. The particular deal of the cards may not be curated, but the underlying system governing your interaction with those cards most certainly is. Likewise, given an agreement on the part of the player to engage with this system, it would be nonsensical to call their predicament unfair. This point may seem either pedantic or embarrassingly self evident depending on your perspective, but it's really the main thrust of what I'm trying to say here.</p>
<p>To put the point another way, it's ultimately entirely arbitrary to deem any system successfully crafted with intentionality unfair. Games are a communication between designer and player, and the correlation between player skill and outcome is just one axis along which the designer can communicate.</p>
<p>"Okay, fine," you might say. "But doesn't a poor correlation between skill and outcome feel like shit?" I argue that a game can overcome this intuitive sounding conclusion when well designed with intentionality. [footnote: I should note that this argument is much easier to make in the case of single player or cooperative games. The subject of fairness in competitive games is it's own can of worms that would be interesting to explore at some point.] Spider Solitaire is testament to that fact. One of the reasons for this is the game's ability to build narrative intrigue.</p>
<p>Narratives in games are a sorely misunderstood subject. In my opinion the narrative power of games is often in facilitating the experience of a storyline borne entirely out of the mechanics of the game. Players don't ultimately (usually) continue to play a game in order to see what happens in the next cutscene, though these moments can often serve as effective rewards for completing milestones. Players continue to play the game because their interactions with its underlying systems provide intrigue of some kind of another. You may think I'm being obtuse and arbitrary in using the word narrative to describe this engagement, but I think oftentimes it's the most accurate characterization.</p>
<p>You are playing a game of Spider Solitaire and a king of spades is stuck on top of an almost complete tableau of cards. If you could only get an empty space to offload that king you could finally use the ace of hearts to clear the stack, freeing up more options in turn. Oh, but now there's a space free, and you realize in this moment you need it to get yourself out of a temporary mess. The king, the goddamned king, will have to stay put for now.</p>
<p>Despite my poor storytelling ability, I hope I've illustrated the way player engagement with a system is often felt as a narrative experience. The same applies to the route full of enemies you trek over and over again to take another crack at a boss in Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Whether framed as narrative or not, games like Spider Solitaire have a distinct effect when contrasted with comparatively predictable games like Dark Souls, a particular form of excitement that can only be achieved in the absence of certainty.</p>
<p>Big para</p>
<p>Now that's what I call excitement!</p>
<p>Playing games that are more predictable like Dark Souls becomes equivalent to watching a movie you've already worked out the ending of. You can still enjoy the twists and turns of the plot, but you lose a sense of tension over the success of the characters. This isn't an insult, those sorts of experiences are a legitimate genre of their own, both in games and in traditional narratives. Nevertheless, Deerstalker's criticism is that of a film producer exclaiming "the audience loves these characters too much to let them die!" It has the same ring of ---, rote convention developed over decades of collective "craft." Considering the rich possibility space they inhabit, games are the worst medium for this kind of creative bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Should games ensure fairness through predictability and curation of content, or should they forgo that goal in favor of the excitement of uncertainty? Dogmatically advocating for either of these outcomes would be a mistake. The only true tenet of games is to create a system that is engaging to interact with. Content is just as much a part of the system as mechanics, and these questions must be answered holistically by the designer.</p>
<p>We've identified some dimensions within which this central tenet can be achieved, but these are ultimately just conceptual tools that must be examined and contextualized within the particular design being worked on.</p>
<p>In the interest of wrangling these thoughts into something more concrete, I'll tentatively lay out a few, hopefully more generalized, tenets of design that seem to work out well regardless of genre.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a system that engages the player in a learning experience.</li>
<li>Create a system with clearly defined rules of player engagement.</li>
<li>Give me gold when I smash things.</li>
</ol>
<p>We should be testing assumptions (including the above) constantly in game design. It's an especially diverse form of art, and as such, designers should strive not to lock themselves into limiting dogma.</p>
<p>Despite my prettily laid down thoughts, of course, Melkhior's Castle could very well be unplayable horseshit. It would be fun to do a follow up review of the game in light of what I've written here.</p>

<p>
Okay so we are going to talk about curation
This will delve into communication beteeen the designer and the player
What is curation communicating? It's telling the player that when a curveball is reached, it was the designer who specifically did that as communication. It's about a sense of trust veteeen player and designer.

// fairness is central to dark souls
What do we lose though? Can we answer that yet?
Let's contrast curation with spider solitaire.
Excitement of not knowing if you will win.
It is random, even with undo and curated games
One could call this broken, I think it's one of the central reasons it's such a good game.
This comes from randomness.
Melkhiors castle seems hardcore
But, here is the appeal
If fairness isn't what's important what is?
Is dark souls flawed because it doesn't have this?
No, both assumptions are flawed. The only true tenet is to create a system that is interesting to engage with.
We've identified some gradients that can serve this tenet, but these are ultimately only tools and can be used in many different ways.
Here are a tentative attempt to lay down some more tenets of game design that generally work out well
1. Create a system that engages the player in a learning experience
2. Create a system with clearly defined rules of player engagement 
3. Give me some goddamn loot when I hit your barrel with my sword
We should be testing assumptions in game design constantly. It's one of the most diverse forms of art, and we could explore even more if we didn't lock ourselves into these sorts of things.
Lots of related issues I want to write more about like the learning, randomness, and the merits of systematic design, as well as what player narrative means in games.
</p>

<p>we explain bitglints meaning, then say this seems to be a case of some different implicit assumptions from both characters, and then say the thing about core tenets of game design, 

then talk about what you think about fun and fairness and mention spider solitaire maybe, the appeal of this castle game is that you are interacting with a system which transcends the loving hand of the designer. No one can save you in here except for yourself and a dose of luck. That's excitement.  (Maybe a line break? Also think about underlines maybe in the same style as hovered links?)

<p>Philisophical implications about the world?</p>

<p>Maybe I should actually play it and do a review, I don't know.</p>
