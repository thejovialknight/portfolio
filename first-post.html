<h1>The point of life | regarding Game Design as art and as craft</h1>
<p>I was browsing through itch.io today (as befits those of only the highest class and distinction) and discovered a fun and archaic looking game called <a href="https://bitglint.itch.io/melkhiors-mansion">Melkhior's Mansion</a>.</p>
<p>The product itself appears to be a pitch perfect homage to a legacy genre of game I only wish I were the type of person to remember fondly. It has a surreal, brightly contrasting 15 color pallete which fits right in with its isometric arenas full of chests, keys, doors, and monsters. Due my ignorance of the form, I shall defer to they who go by the username <a href="https://itch.io/profile/monkeybot">monkeybot</a>, who writes, "That's great,Took me strainght (sic) back to 1984!!  Most excellent!" Need I say more?</p>
<p>I noticed a thread near the top between commenter <a href="https://itch.io/profile/shino1">Deerstalker Games</a> and the developer, <a href="https://itch.io/profile/shino1">BitGlint Games</a>, who's arguments (if you like) about the design of the game got me thinking about the massive diversity in possible ways of thinking about the design, art, and craft of games in general. It seems this a matrix too often unnoticed. But I think I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>The thread begins with a negative review of the game by Deerstalker.</p>

    <p>Am I missing something? It seemed to me as if enemy movements were completely random, which in a game with one-hit kills and limited lives is kinda insane. Isn't entire point of any platformer, isometric or not, is ability to predict timing of your enemies and obstacles so you can plan your movement? I haven't much experience with isometric platformers, but both Batman and Head Over Heels remakes had predictable and easily read enemy patterns - it was clear how to avoid them, the difficulty was in the execution (also in traps and puzzles).

The aesthetics are amazing and so is the idea, but I genuinelly cannot grasp enemy patterns.</p>
