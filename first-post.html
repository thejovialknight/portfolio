<h1>The point of life</h1>
<h2>regarding game design as art and craft</h2>  
<p>I was browsing through <a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a> today (as befits those of only the highest class and distinction) and discovered a fun and archaic looking game called <a href="https://bitglint.itch.io/melkhiors-mansion">Melkhior's Mansion</a>.</p>
<p>The product itself appears to be a pitch perfect homage to a legacy genre of game I only wish I were the type of person to remember fondly. It has a surreal, brightly contrasting 15 color pallete which fits right in with its isometric arenas full of chests, keys, doors, and monsters. Due my ignorance of the form, I shall defer to the user <a href="https://itch.io/profile/monkeybot">monkeybot</a>, who comments:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>"That's great,Took me strainght (sic) back to 1984!!  Most excellent!"</p> 
</blockquote>
<p>Need I say more?</p>
<p>I noticed a thread near the top between commenter <a href="https://itch.io/profile/shino1">Deerstalker Games</a> and the developer, <a href="https://itch.io/profile/shino1">BitGlint Games</a>, who's arguments (if you like) about the design of the game got me thinking about the massive diversity in possible ways of thinking about the design, art, and craft of games in general. It seems this a matrix too often unnoticed, but I think I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>The thread begins with a negative review of the game by Deerstalker.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Am I missing something? It seemed to me as if enemy movements were completely random, which in a game with one-hit kills and limited lives is kinda insane. Isn't entire point of any platformer, isometric or not, is ability to predict timing of your enemies and obstacles so you can plan your movement? I haven't much experience with isometric platformers, but both Batman and Head Over Heels remakes had predictable and easily read enemy patterns - it was clear how to avoid them, the difficulty was in the execution (also in traps and puzzles).</p>
    <p>The aesthetics are amazing and so is the idea, but I genuinelly cannot grasp enemy patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A seemingly reasonable complaint. The developer, BitGlint, responds with some explanation.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Thanks for the feedback. It's based on Atic Atac on the ZX Spectrum, which had random movement patterns. Quite a lot of games back then had random movement, especially the Ultimate games. This is a run around exploration game, whereas Batman and HoH are puzzle solving games, so it's important for enemy positions to be predictable. In games like Atic Atac, it isn't, in my humble opinion. Hope it hasn't spoilt it too much for you, but if it's not your thing, that's cool, thanks for trying it out. ;o)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An equally reasonable appeal to tradition. It seems this isn't the sort of game Deerstalker thought they were playing, and perhaps isn't the sort they're interested in. Discontented by this truth, they launch into a more involved criticism of the design.TBH * I think I give away the plot a bit too much here. I shouldn't take sides until it makes sense to.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Everything inside of me as a designer yells that that's a terrible idea but I'm trying to be openminded. How do you prevent player from getting stuck in an unwinnable situation if patterns are random? It's a game with one hit kills and limited lives, and it might just downright not be your fault if you die and lose all your progress because all enemies randomly decided to surround you.</p>
    <p>It's not what I'd personally call good game design but if your primary goal isn't to make a game that appeals to a modern audience with 'fun' but to simply make a clear homage to these games of old without concern of modern concepts of 'fairness' (which to be fair is a bit nebulous) then sure, more power to you.</p>
    <p>I guess there's other revivals of classic isometric platform-adventures I can try, like Abbey of Crime, Naya's Quest, King Boo or Lumo.</p>
    <p>It's probably not for me, but a lot of people in this comment section seem to love it, so good on you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally, back to BitGlint.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Thanks for the feedback. If you want to discuss it further then please feel free to contact me directly. I'm not one for public debate, it never ends well. :o)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That marks an end to the festivities, leaving us to imagine the rest.</p>

<p>I should note that the following is only my feverish imaginings of what these two people stand for, and I haven't played the game being discussed. I'm going to utilize them as characters in my realm of analysis, but this thread was nothing more than a prompt to espouse my thoughts on game design. It might be interesting to go back and play the game and make a part 2 review piece, but that context doesn't seem to me particularly relevant to what I have to say here.</p>
<p>Let's try to break down what Deerstalker is arguing for here. They start off with a criticism that the game's enemy movements seem to be entirely randomized, and that what makes this sort of game fun is being able to plan out your moves in context of your knowledge of enemy behavior. The player's lack of ability to predict enemy movements prevents them from having a meaningful engagement with the game's systems.</p>
<p>He contrasts that with counter examples which allow this engagement, pointing out that the difficulty in these games comes from skill of execution, rather than from unpredictability. The designer's response is basically, "this is by design," and Deerstalker sums up his second main point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>are grRrr gararaarrr!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without being able to predict enemy movement, the game loses its sense of fairness, and you may lose all your progress based on a random, unwinnable situation.</p>
<p>Let's compare this with the intent of the designer..</p>
<p>Just like with Deerstalker's comments we can glean two main insights from BitGlint's response.</p>
<p>kk it's the appeal to legacy and then the appeal to it being a run around exploration game which doesn't require that stuff.</p>
<p>response to below sentence, we explain bitglints meaning, then say this seems to be a case of some different implicit assumptions from both characters, and then say the thing about core tenets of game design, then talk about what you think about fun and fairness and mention spider solitaire maybe, the appeal of this castle game is that you are interacting with a system which transcends the loving hand of the designer. No one can save you in here except for yourself and a dose of luck. That's excitement.  (Maybe a line break? Also think about underlines maybe in the same style as hovered links?)
<p>Something needs to be thought of with the flow of this next parts. Should I get to the criticism of points quickly, marking a sort of more aggressive part 2 of the essay? Or should I save my thoughts for the end? Personally, I think I should get to the meat quickly, I think to the reader the moderateness would have overstayed its welcome by this point.</p>

<p>What do we gain with a design like this?</p>

<p>Okay, but what do we lose? Enter spider solitaire.</p>

<p>There exists a hypothetical world in which there are core tenets of game design. Break these tenets and you sacrifice the game's level of "fun," or whatever other metrics one comes up with to judge the quality of a design. While one may not agree that these tenets exist, I think those internalized by Deerstalker are indicative of a failiure within mainstream game design culture at large.</p>
<p>Chief among these distinctions is that video games, in order to be "fun", must be fair. To put it perhaps more generally, games must continally and sytematically curate the player experience so that (ideally) every experience they have in the game lives up to the maximum potential of the design. The player should be given decisions or challenges appropriate to their skill level, and those decisions or challenges are designed to be as interesting or engaging as possible.</p>
<p>Never should a challenge the player is meant to complete be impossible. We call that a "bug". That's just common sense!</p>

<p>Philisophical implications about the world?</p>

<p>Maybe I should actually play it and do a review, I don't know.</p>
