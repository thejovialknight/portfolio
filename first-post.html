<h1>Playing fair</h1>
<h2>regarding game design as art and craft</h2>  
<p>I was browsing through <a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a> today (as befits those of only the highest class and distinction) and discovered a fun and archaic-looking game called <a href="https://bitglint.itch.io/melkhiors-mansion">Melkhior's Mansion</a>.</p>
<p>The product itself appears to be a pitch-perfect homage to a legacy genre of game I only wish I were the type of person to remember fondly. It has a surreal, brightly contrasting 15-color palette which fits right in with its isometric arenas full of chests, keys, doors, and monsters. Due my ignorance of the form, I shall defer to the user monkeybot who comments:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>"That's great,Took me strainght back to 1984!!  Most excellent!"</p> 
</blockquote>
<p>And that's pretty much all there is to say.</p>
<p>I noticed a thread near the top between commenter Deerstalker Games and the developer, BitGlint Games, whose arguments (if you like) about the design of the game got me thinking about the massive diversity in possible ways of thinking about the design, art, and craft of games in general. It seems this a matrix too often unnoticed, but I think I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>The thread begins with a negative review of the game by Deerstalker.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Am I missing something? It seemed to me as if enemy movements were completely random, which in a game with one-hit kills and limited lives is kinda insane. Isn't entire point of any platformer, isometric or not, is ability to predict timing of your enemies and obstacles so you can plan your movement? I haven't much experience with isometric platformers, but both Batman and Head Over Heels remakes had predictable and easily read enemy patterns - it was clear how to avoid them, the difficulty was in the execution (also in traps and puzzles).</p>
    <p>The aesthetics are amazing and so is the idea, but I genuinelly cannot grasp enemy patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A seemingly reasonable complaint. The developer, BitGlint, responds with some explanation.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Thanks for the feedback. It's based on Atic Atac on the ZX Spectrum, which had random movement patterns. Quite a lot of games back then had random movement, especially the Ultimate games. This is a run around exploration game, whereas Batman and HoH are puzzle solving games, so it's important for enemy positions to be predictable. In games like Atic Atac, it isn't, in my humble opinion. Hope it hasn't spoilt it too much for you, but if it's not your thing, that's cool, thanks for trying it out. ;o)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An equally reasonable appeal to tradition, as well as vague allusions to genre differences between the mentioned games, ending with a friendly agree-to-disagree sentiment. Back to Deerstalker.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Everything inside of me as a designer yells that that's a terrible idea but I'm trying to be openminded. How do you prevent player from getting stuck in an unwinnable situation if patterns are random? It's a game with one hit kills and limited lives, and it might just downright not be your fault if you die and lose all your progress because all enemies randomly decided to surround you.</p>
    <p>It's not what I'd personally call good game design but if your primary goal isn't to make a game that appeals to a modern audience with 'fun' but to simply make a clear homage to these games of old without concern of modern concepts of 'fairness' (which to be fair is a bit nebulous) then sure, more power to you.</p>
    <p>I guess there's other revivals of classic isometric platform-adventures I can try, like Abbey of Crime, Naya's Quest, King Boo or Lumo.</p>
    <p>It's probably not for me, but a lot of people in this comment section seem to love it, so good on you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds impressive! Finally, back to BitGlint.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Thanks for the feedback. If you want to discuss it further then please feel free to contact me directly. I'm not one for public debate, it never ends well. :o</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That marks an end to the festivities, leaving us only to imagine the rest.</p>
<p>Note that the following is only my feverish imaginings of what these two people stand for, and I haven't played the game being discussed. I'm going to utilize them as characters in my realm of analysis, but this thread was nothing more than a prompt to espouse my thoughts on game design. It might be interesting to go back and play the game and make a part 2 review piece, but that context doesn't seem to me particularly relevant to what I have to say here.</p>
<p>Let's try to break down what Deerstalker is arguing for here. They start off with a criticism that the game's enemy movements seem to be entirely randomized, and that what makes this sort of game fun is being able to plan out your moves in context of your knowledge of enemy behavior. The player's lack of ability to predict enemy movements prevents them from having a meaningful engagement with the game's systems.</p>
<p>They contrast this with counter-examples of games that allow for this engagement, pointing out that the difficulty there comes from skill of execution, rather than from unpredictability. The designer's response states basically, "this is by design," and Deerstalker sums up their second main point.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>How do you prevent player from getting stuck in an unwinnable situation if patterns are random? It's a game with one hit kills and limited lives, and it might just downright not be your fault if you die and lose all your progress because all enemies randomly decided to surround you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without being able to predict enemy movement, the game loses its sense of fairness. The player can easily lose all their progress based on a random, unwinnable situation.</p>
<p>Let's compare this with the intent of the designer. Just like with Deerstalker's comments we can glean two main insights from BitGlint's response.</p>
<p>BitGlint first makes their appeal to the legacy of the genre they are emulating, stating that "a lot of games back then had random movement." This is a good enough justification in itself, but doesn't directly provide an answer to Deerstalker's criticism. Our only hint of their thoughts as a designer comes next.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>This is a run around exploration game, whereas Batman and HoH are puzzle solving games, so it's important for enemy positions to be predictable. In games like Atic Atac, it isn't, in my humble opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The distinction interpreted by BitGlint here is between a puzzle-solving game that requires predictability in order to analyze and execute your plans, and what they call a "run around exploration game" which does not. The idea is that the goals for player engagement between the two genres are distinct. The puzzle-solving genre uses planning and execution as its primary mode of play, and Melkhior's Castle uses exploration.</p>
<p>Deerstalker's second reply accurately identifies the problem of fairness in this design. In my opinion, however, they fail to recognize the ways in which this "flaw" actually plays to the strengths of the design's intended goal, which is to engage the player in a different way.</p>
<p>This seems to be a case of different implicit assumptions about the ideals of designing games.</p>
<p>There exists a hypothetical world in which there are core tenets of game design. Break these tenets and you sacrifice the game's level of "fun," or whatever other metrics one comes up with to judge the quality of a design. While one may not agree that these tenets exist, I think those internalized by Deerstalker are indicative of a failure within mainstream game design culture at large.</p>
<p>Chief among these distinctions is that video games, in order to be "fun", must be fair. To put it perhaps more generally, games must continually and systematically curate the player experience so that (ideally) <em>every experience they have in the game lives up to the maximum potential of the design.</em> The player should be given decisions or challenges appropriate to their skill level, and those decisions or challenges should be designed to be as interesting or engaging as possible.</p>
<p>Never should a challenge the player is meant to complete be impossible. That's just common sense!</p>
<p>This ideal of fairness seems to be an area of focus with today's designers. One can hardly get through a conversation about From Software's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls">Dark Souls</a> without mentioning that its extreme difficulty nevertheless "feels fair." This is in some sense the most universally understood legacy of From's Software,<span class="note" data-note-text="Some tomfoolery for you."></span> a sense that your inability to meet the game's challenge is always ultimately <em>your fault</em>, rather than the game's.</p>
<p>The appeal of many games is rooted in the human desire to control their environment. This can often lead to games that are nothing more than empty exercises in rote organization and, at best, optimization. These games which try for little more than exploiting this control element of our reward pathways are video game's heroin. They achieve nothing more than diminishing returns of empty satisfaction.</p>
<p>This is not to say games should not choose organization and optimization as the core element of their design. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity">Sim City</a> is arguably a more sophisticated version of this paradigm than a game like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_V:_Skyrim">Skyrim</a>, which is in turn a more sophisticated approach than <a href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/">Cookie Clicker</a>.<span class="note" data-note-text="This passage might understate the fact that I find all three of these games fun, and especially in the case of games like Sim City, I find optimization to be one of the most deeply satisfying of all core gameplay mechanics. The problem with them, arguably, is that it's hard to do in a sufficiently complex way to avoid being topologically indistinguishable from Cookie Clicker, and while I do find Cookie Clicker fun, I think its mechanics are clearly intended as a satire of those sorts of mindless experiences."></span> The relative merit of different paradigms is a function of the finer details of their approach. One of the core tenets I see in good game design is that a game's success is often determined by how interesting its central lessons are. In other words, games are defined largely by what they teach you, and your enjoyment of them is largely determined by how engaged you are with what that is.</p>
<p>Dark Souls is so successful because of its singular focus on adherence to this tenet. Where Skyrim eventually devolves into the infamous "laundry list" of indistinguishable fetch quests whilst trying to somehow convince the player that this sort of gameplay has inherent value, Dark Souls is intended to exercise your ability to learn the ins and outs of both the geography of the environment and the skills of its combat system. Both fairness and meticulous curation of content are central to the player's process of improving this ability.</p>
<p>It may be self-evident to you why fairness is important to the goal of player engagement in learning a game system. A player's ability to learn the system is in some sense proportional to what extent it's possible to learn the underlying rules of that system, and the concept of fairness in games is in some sense equivalent to how consistent and ultimately readable those rules are. If I learn a particular enemy's attack pattern and then build up the mechanical skill to exploit it, I would be very discouraged if suddenly that pattern changed for seemingly no reason. I would never even have been able to learn it in the first place if those patterns had always been random and unreadable.</p>
<p>Content curation is a related yet independent axis of design from fairness, and both of these are ultimately dependent on a feeling of <em>direct communication between the designer and the player</em>.</p>
<p>When a puzzle game presents you with a novel idea and allows you to explore it within a set of chosen constraints, that's a designer communicating insights. The designer can further communicate their idea by modifying or complicating previously learned mechanics, peeling away the onion layers until the full scope of the game's ideas is revealed. This engagement is ultimately based on trust on the part of the player that whatever is being communicated by the game is intentional. When a player gets the sense that the communication they are receiving is unintentional, it can cause them to lose faith in the designer and perhaps also in the game's level of fairness.<span class="note" data-note-text="Of course, intentionality isn't the only factor at play here, as the player is well within their right to judge an intentional idea as also being a bad one. I'll be addressing that in context of the subject of the article a little later."></span> A designer can try to ensure this doesn't happen by curating every moment of gameplay to be as intentionally meaningful as possible. All of these ideas apply just as much to Dark Souls as they do to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(series)">Portal</a>.</p>
<p>Is it possible to build a sense of communication and trust with the player without careful content curation and even a sense of fairness? I can think of no better example than what I consider one of the great games of all time: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_(solitaire)">Spider</a>.</p>
<p>If you've never played it before, Spider is a variant of Solitaire which involves creating "tableaus" of contiguous, same-suited cards. I won't go into the nitty gritty details here, but it is made up of an often frustratingly dense web of discrete decisions that inhabit a huge possibility space. The butterfly effect is prominent. A single move can drastically close off large branches of the decision tree, and keeping track of all these elements is a tricky mental task.<span class="note" data-note-text="My preferred mode is two suit with liberal use of undo. Cry more."></span></p>
<p>Is Spider a curated experience? Not in its purest form, no. A randomly distributed deal of the cards isn't even guaranteed to be winnable at all. Even when playing on a computer with difficulty settings, and even with liberal use of the undo feature, the massive tree of choices still tends to effectively nullify the player's confidence in being able to win any given round.</p>
<p>Can Spider be considered fair, then? Not intuitively so. The game's setup is entirely random, and more importantly, your success is quite often more a function of card distribution than player skill.</p>
<p>And yet, all it takes is a reframing of the question to turn those answers from no to yes. The particular deal of the cards may not be curated, but the underlying system governing your interaction with those cards most certainly is. Likewise, given an agreement on the part of the player to engage with this system, it would be nonsensical to call their predicament unfair.</p>
<p>This point may seem either pedantic or embarrassingly self-evident depending on your perspective, but it's also the main thrust of what I'm trying to explore here.</p>
<p>Put another way, it's ultimately entirely arbitrary to deem any system which is successfully crafted with intentionality unfair. Games are communication between designer and player, and the particular correlation between player skill and outcome is just one axis along which the designer can communicate.</p>
<p>"Okay, fine," you might say. "But doesn't a poor correlation between skill and outcome feel like shit?" I argue that a game can overcome this seemingly intuitive conclusion when well-designed <em>with intentionality</em>.<span class="note" data-note-text="I should note that this argument is much easier to make in the case of single player or cooperative games. The subject of fairness in competitive games is it's own can of worms that would be interesting to explore at some point."></span> Spider is a testament to that fact. One of the reasons for this is the game's ability to build narrative intrigue.</p>
<p>Narratives in games are a sorely misunderstood subject. Largely, the narrative power of games isn't found in the explicitly laid out plot, but instead in the experience of a story borne entirely out of the mechanics of the game. Players (usually) don't ultimately continue to play a game to see what happens in the next cutscene, though these moments can often serve as effective rewards for completing milestones. Players continue to play the game because their interactions with its underlying systems provide engagement of some kind or another. You might think it obtuse and arbitrary to use the word narrative to describe this engagement, but I think oftentimes it's the most accurate characterization.</p>
<p>Say you are playing a game of Spider and a king of spades is stuck on top of an almost complete tableau of cards. If you could only get free up a space to offload that king onto you could finally use the ace of hearts to clear the stack, freeing up more options in turn. Oh, but now there's a space open, and you realize that now you need it to get yourself out of some other temporary mess. The king, the goddamned king, will have to stay put for now.</p>
<p>Despite my poor storytelling ability,<span class="note" data-note-text"In truth, describing the internal narrative of an actual game of Spider would be too convoluted to describe elegantly in words. That's a good takeaway point, in fact. If it could be described properly in an essay what then would the power of games as a medium be?"></span> I hope I've illustrated the way player engagement with a system is often felt as a narrative experience. The same applies to the route full of enemies you trek over and over again to take another crack at a boss in Dark Souls.</p>
<p>Whether framed as narrative or not, playing games like Spider has a distinct effect when contrasted with comparatively predictable games like Dark Souls, a particular form of excitement that can only be achieved in the absence of certainty.</p>
<p>In these games, the role of the designer isn't to curate a series of experiences for the player to learn from cumulatively; it's to create a system of engaging rules that is under no obligation to reward the player for good behavior. In Spider, the lack of guarantee of success even given skillful play gives the metagame an incredibly <em>organic</em> experience of narrative ups and downs. Your job as a player is to give yourself the best possible chance. Winning a round under these circumstances brings a form of satisfaction that cannot be replicated by a more balanced, fair system.</p>
<p>The appeal of these games is that you are interacting with a system that transcends the loving hand of the designer. No one can save you in here except for yourself and a healthy dose of luck. That's <em>excitement</em>.</p>
<p>Playing games with more predictability becomes equivalent to watching a movie you've already worked out the ending of. You can still enjoy the twists and turns of the plot, but you lose a sense of tension over the success of the characters. This isn't an insult to those sorts of experiences. They are a legitimate genre of their own, both in games and in traditional narratives.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Deerstalker's criticism is that of a film producer exclaiming "the audience loves these characters too much to let them die!" It has the same ring of mindless, rote convention developed over decades of collective "craft." Considering the rich possibility space they inhabit, games are the worst candidate for this kind of creative bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Should games ensure fairness through predictability and curation of content, or should they forgo that goal in favor of the excitement of uncertainty? Dogmatically advocating for either of these outcomes would be a mistake. The only true tenet of game design is to create a system that is engaging to interact with. Content is just as much a part of that system as mechanics, and these questions must be answered holistically by the designer. We've identified some dimensions along which this core tenet can be calibrated, but these are ultimately just conceptual tools that must be contextualized within the particular design being worked on.</p>
<p>In the interest of wrangling all of these thoughts into something more concrete - and perhaps something more actionable - I'll tentatively lay out a few (hopefully more generalized) tenets of design that seem to work out well regardless of genre.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a system that engages the player in a learning experience.</li>
    <li>Create a system with clearly defined rules for player engagement.</li>
    <li>Give me gold when I smash things.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately, playing a game is a process of learning a system, and the more care designers give to this fact, the better. In addition, the thing that makes one game distinct from another is the set of rules that govern its system as a whole. These rules include both the content of the game and its mechanics.</p>
<p>We should be testing our assumptions constantly in game design. With such a diverse medium of art, designers should strive not to lock themselves into limiting dogma. The goal instead should be to keep our minds as open to radical ideas as possible, especially when it comes to the most fundamental assumptions of the form.</p>
<hr>
<p class="post-script">This piece incorporated a lot of nebulous thoughts about game design that I wasn't able to fully expound my thoughts on, including concepts of games as a learning process, randomness, game narratives, and the merits of systematic vs content-driven design. In the future I want to write more about these topics. I also want to do a follow-up review of Melkhior's Castle as mentioned. In addition, I've got some ongoing programming projects that I'd like to write about here as well. I hope you'll stop by to check those out if and when they're written.</p>
