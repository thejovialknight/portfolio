<h1>The point of life | regarding Game Design as art and as craft</h1>
<p>I was browsing through <a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a> today (as befits those of only the highest class and distinction) and discovered a fun and archaic looking game called <a href="https://bitglint.itch.io/melkhiors-mansion">Melkhior's Mansion</a>.</p>
<p>The product itself appears to be a pitch perfect homage to a legacy genre of game I only wish I were the type of person to remember fondly. It has a surreal, brightly contrasting 15 color pallete which fits right in with its isometric arenas full of chests, keys, doors, and monsters. Due my ignorance of the form, I shall defer to they who go by the username <a href="https://itch.io/profile/monkeybot">monkeybot</a>, who writes, "That's great,Took me strainght (sic) back to 1984!!  Most excellent!" Need I say more?</p>
<p>I noticed a thread near the top between commenter <a href="https://itch.io/profile/shino1">Deerstalker Games</a> and the developer, <a href="https://itch.io/profile/shino1">BitGlint Games</a>, who's arguments (if you like) about the design of the game got me thinking about the massive diversity in possible ways of thinking about the design, art, and craft of games in general. It seems this a matrix too often unnoticed, but I think I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>The thread begins with a negative review of the game by Deerstalker.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Am I missing something? It seemed to me as if enemy movements were completely random, which in a game with one-hit kills and limited lives is kinda insane. Isn't entire point of any platformer, isometric or not, is ability to predict timing of your enemies and obstacles so you can plan your movement? I haven't much experience with isometric platformers, but both Batman and Head Over Heels remakes had predictable and easily read enemy patterns - it was clear how to avoid them, the difficulty was in the execution (also in traps and puzzles).</p>
    <p>The aesthetics are amazing and so is the idea, but I genuinelly cannot grasp enemy patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A seemingly reasonable complaint. The developer, BitGlint, responds with some explanation.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Thanks for the feedback. It's based on Atic Atac on the ZX Spectrum, which had random movement patterns. Quite a lot of games back then had random movement, especially the Ultimate games. This is a run around exploration game, whereas Batman and HoH are puzzle solving games, so it's important for enemy positions to be predictable. In games like Atic Atac, it isn't, in my humble opinion. Hope it hasn't spoilt it too much for you, but if it's not your thing, that's cool, thanks for trying it out. ;o)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An equally reasonable appeal to tradition. It seems this isn't the sort of game Deerstalker thought he was playing, and perhaps isn't the sort he's interested in. Discontented by this truth, he launches into a more involved criticism of the design.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Everything inside of me as a designer yells that that's a terrible idea but I'm trying to be openminded. How do you prevent player from getting stuck in an unwinnable situation if patterns are random? It's a game with one hit kills and limited lives, and it might just downright not be your fault if you die and lose all your progress because all enemies randomly decided to surround you.</p>
    <p>It's not what I'd personally call good game design but if your primary goal isn't to make a game that appeals to a modern audience with 'fun' but to simply make a clear homage to these games of old without concern of modern concepts of 'fairness' (which to be fair is a bit nebulous) then sure, more power to you.</p>
    <p>I guess there's other revivals of classic isometric platform-adventures I can try, like Abbey of Crime, Naya's Quest, King Boo or Lumo.</p>
    <p>It's probably not for me, but a lot of people in this comment section seem to love it, so good on you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally, back to BitGlint.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Thanks for the feedback. If you want to discuss it further then please feel free to contact me directly. I'm not one for public debate, it never ends well. :o)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That marks an end to the festivities, leaving us to imagine the rest.</p>
